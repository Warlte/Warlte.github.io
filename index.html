      <h3>
        it’s safe to say that the world has a large problem with pollution right
        now and from what you might read in articles online or se in documentaries
        or other media the problem might seem insurmountable but we're here to
        tell you that this problem is solvable and we are going to show you a
        couple ways this can be achieved.

        But first let’s discuss how this problem affects people and the world around us.
        It has a very large impact on people living in poorer countries since a large
        amount of the richer countries' garbage ends up being dumped there creating
        these large mountains of garbage. This has a negative effect on the people
        living there in their health and creates an unsafe environment for those living
        nearby.

            <h3 class="rubrik">Recycling</h3>
            <h3>
              A very simple solution in theory is to just recycle a lot more than
              we already do since that would mean less trash in landfills and
              allows us to reuse resources. Although not all countries have the
              necessary infrastructure to allow for this unfortunately.

            <h3 class="rubrik">Biodegradable</h3>
            <h3>One of the big problems with trash is that a lot of it just does
              not decompose at all so it just sits wherever it was dumped forever
              and causes harm. One of the most common forms of non degradable
              trash is plastic. But there have been efforts in order to make
              biodegradable plastic bottles with a halflife of 18 months.

            <h3>
              The majority of plastic in the ocean from rivers however comes
              from around 10 countries. The Yangtze alone flushes down 1.5
              million tons every year. a lot of this is because. A lot of this
              comes from developing countries that have industrialized at a very
              rapid pace making the trash disposal not be able to keep up. this
              could be solved by countries investing in helping these countries
              solve the problem.</h3>

            <h3 class="rubrik">Plasma</h3>
            <h3>
              A future solution is plasma gasification which is when you pass
              electricity through two electrodes which produces a temperature
              higher than the surface of the sun in a no oxygen environment. This
              does not burn the trash though since it takes place in a zero
              oxygen environment and instead breaks down the molecular bonds
              making the trash into gas or slag. The gas can in turn be used to
              power the plant.

          In conclusion it is important to look at the garbage problem the world
          has from a global perspective and not only look for ways to solve the
          problem in your own country but also to help other countries deal with
          theirs.
